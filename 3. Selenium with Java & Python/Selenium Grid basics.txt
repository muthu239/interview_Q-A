Selenium Grid - Selenium 3
	Selenium grid is distributed text execution environment
	Selenium grid is a part of the selenium suite that specializes in running multiple tests across different browsers, operating systems, and machines in parallel
	
	What is Need for selenium grid
		Selenium webdriver will execute your test cases on a single machine. Some of the concerns with webdriver are,
			1. What if you want to execute your test cases for different operating systems?
			2. How to run test cases in the different version of the same browser?
			3. How to run your test cases in multiple browsers?
			4. Why should a scenario wait for execution of other test cases even if it does not depend upon any test cases?
			
		
	Benefits of selenium grid
		1. Selenium grid gives the flexibility to distribute your test cases for execution
		2. Reduces batch processing time
		3. Can perform multi browser testing
		4. Can perform multi os testing
		
	
	Selenium grid is an stand alone project
	you will get the selenium jar
	
	To run the selenium grid,user need to run the selenium grid jar via command
		command : java -jar <Selenium_jar_name> -role hub
		
		verify selenium grid via URL in Local
				http://localhost:4444/grid/console
		
	
	Selenium Hub
		Selenium Hub is windows/Linux machine, which will be used as execution engine in selenium grid.
		Selenium Hub is central machine, which will be connected via several machines(nodes) over the network
		Selenium Hub will be used as execution engine to execute selenium tests in parallel and send the commands to various machine
		There is only one hub in the selenium grid
		
		Create selenium Hub
			To create selenium hub, user needs to start the selenium jar
			User needs to provide the Role 'Hub' in the selenium jar execution command
				command: java -jar <selenium_jar_name> -role hub
				
			verify selenium hub via URL in Local
				http://localhost:4444/grid/console
				
			Nodes should register to http://localhost:4444/grid/register/
			Clients should connect to http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
			
	Selenium Node
		Selenium node is the machine where actual execution will run
		Test case will execute on selenium node
		There can be multiple nodes in selenium grid
		Each selenium node communicates with the selenium hub and performs test case assigned to it
		Nodes can be launched on multiple machines with different platforms and browsers
		
		Create selenium node
			To create selenium Node, selenium hub must be started
			Selenium Jar must be present on the machine where you want to start the selenium node
			To start the selenium node/make the machine selenium node. Run the command
			
			command: java -jar <selenium_jar> -role webdriver -hub 
			http://<ip_of_selelniumHub>:4444/grid/register -port 5556
						
			To verify you can visit http://<hub_ip>:4444/grid/console on any machine
			
	
			
	Browser on selenium nodes
		Browser instance and browsers are specific to requirements
		Number of nodes could be specific to requirements
		Start selenium hub
		Start Selenium node
		
	Create instance of specific browser on selenium node
		command : -browser browserName = <Browser_name>
		
	We can define number of instance of any browser in selenium node
		command : -browser browserName = <name>, maxinstances = <Number_of_instances>
		
	Why session is required?
		Define Number of session on selenium Node
			command : -maxSession 5
			
		Now we have defined 5 sessions. It measn it doesnt matter how many instances are available, at a time selenium will invoke only 5 instances
		
	Can we open multiple nodes on the single machine?
		yes, it is possible to open more than node with a single machine but it is not preferrable
		
	Selenium node : configure drivers
		We need to tell the driver location to selenium node
		
		Define Chrome driver to selenium node:
			Invoke selenium hub first
			Invoke the selenium node and append the driver path in command
				-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=<Driver_location>
				
			complete command:
				java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver = <Driver_location> -jar <jar_name> -role webdriver -hub <Hub_location> -port 5556 - browser browserName = chrome
				
			eg: Chrome + IE + Edge + Firefox
				java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=D:\Drivers\chromedriver.exe  -Dwebdriver.ie.driver=D:\Drivers\IEDriverServer.exe  -Dwebdriver.edge.driver=D:\Drivers\MicrosoftWebDriver.exe  -Dwebdriver.firefox.driver=D:\Drivers\geckodriver.exe  -jar selenium-Grid.jar  -role webdriver -hub http://192.168.0.101:4444/grid/register/ -port 5556 -browser browserName=chrome -browser browserName=iexplore -browser  browserName=edge -browser  browserName=firefox
	
	
	Selenium grid :  TestNG
		To run the testcases with selenium grid on the remote machine, you need to use RemoteWebDriver
		RemoteWebDriver is an implementation class of the webDriver interface that a testscript developer can use to execute their test scripts via the RemoteWebDriver server in a remote machine
