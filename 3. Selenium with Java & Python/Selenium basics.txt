What is selenium?
	Selenium is a web based automation tool. Used to automate web based automation
	Selenium is a third party open source tool
	
Browser support - selenium:
	Mozilla firefox, Google chrome,Internet explorer,opera,Safari
		
Selenium programming language support:
	Java, C#, python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP
	
Issue might come with framework utils file path and all the file paths

does minimize exist in selenium?
	In selenium 4 it exists. but not in selenium 3
	
How will you minimize a screen?
	int width = 600; int height = 400; 
	Dimension dimension = new Dimension(width, height); 
	driver. manage(). window(). setSize(dimension);
	
	With selenium4 we have minimize method
		driver.manage().window().minimize();
	
How will you switch window in selenium 3
	driver.switchTo().window(String GUID)
	
How to pass keyboard shortcut to selenium?
	driver.findElement(By.xpath("xpath")).sendKeys(Keys.PAGE_DOWN)
	
How to scroll using selenium without JS executor?
	driver.findElement(By.xpath("xpath")).sendKeys(Keys.PAGE_DOWN)
		or
	WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("ur selector"));//u can use By.xpath or By.id here
	Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
	actions.moveToElement(element);
	actions.perform();
	
How do you verify the colour using selenium?
	getCssValue() and verify



ctrl + u -> to view page source
F12 / ctrl + shif + i -> to view developer tools
ctrl + shift +  c -> to inspect an element

Selenium	
	Selenium is an open source UI automation tool
	Selenium is used to automate web based application
	selenium is not used for desktop based application automation
	Selenium is not a tool. It is a package where we have lot of tools 
	
Components of selenium
	Selenium IDE
	Selenium RC
	Selenium webdriver
	Selenium Grid
	
	Selenium IDE(Integrated Development environment)
		Selenium IDE is record and play back base tool
		Selenium IDE is basically a browser plugin, which is compatible with mozilla only
		It's easy to learn, use and install.
		
		Limitations of Selenium IDE
			Since selenium IDE is a browser plugin, we cannot use it in other programming
			Only compatible with mozilla and not other browsers
			User is not allowed to put conditions in IDE
			
	Selenium RC
		Selenium RC stands for remote control
		RC is the first automated web testing tool that allowed users to use a programming language they prefer
		User is allowed to use Java, C#, PHP, perl, Ruby and python with selenium RC
		
		Pros
			Cross browser and platform
			Perform loops and conditional statements
			Data driven testing is possible
			Can support multiple browsers and faster than the IDE
			
		Cons
			More complicated than the IDE
			Programming knowledge is must
			Selenium RC server needs to be run to start the execution
			Slow than webdriver and poor support for javascript
			
	Selenium webdriver
		- Selenium WebDriver is better than selenium IDE and RC
		- Since the launch of the selenium webdriver 3 the RC is considered as depreceated and selenium company is not planning to upgrade RC but their focus is on webdriver
		- Selenium WebDriver is more stable than RC
		- WebDriver, unlike selenium RC, does not rely on Javascript for automation. It controls the browser by directly communicating with it.
		- Selenium WebDriver supports mulitple programming language. Java, C#, python, PHP, perl, Ruby
	
	Selenium Grid
		Selenium Grid is tool used for parallel execution
		Selenium grid is compatible with RC and WebDriver both
		It works like an execution engine for selenium tests
		Enables simultaneous running of tests in multiple browsers and environments
		Utilizes the hub and nodes concept. The hub acts as a central source of selenium commands to each node connected to it
===================================================================================================		

Selenium Vs QTP(UFT)
	Selenium
		- Open source, free to use and free of charge
		- Highly extensible
		- Can run tests across different browsers
		- Can support multiple browsers and faster than IDE
		- Supports various operating systems
		- Can execute tests while the browser is minimized
		- Can execute tests in parallel
		- Can only test web applications
		- Has no built in object repository
		- Data driven is more cumbersome since you have to rely on the programming language
		
	QTP(UFT)
		- Commercial, License are high cost
		- Limited add-ons
		- Can run test only in firefox, IE and chrome
		- Slow than webdriver and poor support to javascript
		- Can only be used in windows
		- Needs to have the application under test to be visible on the desktop
		- Can only execute in parallel but using quality center which is again a paid product
		- Can test both web and desktop applications
		- Comes with built in object repository
		- Data driven testing is easier to perform because it has built in global and local data tables
		
===================================================================================================================
Whats new in Selenium 4
	Selenium 4 alpha 3 release on April 2019
	Selenium 4 have few major improvements over selenium 3
	No major changes in selenium 3 generic fucntionality or end user usability
	Selenium 4 has built in support for microsoft edge browser, so no need for separate webdriver
	
	Major features introduced in selenium 4 are :
	-> Enhanced version of selenium grid
			Earlier version of selenium grid was complex to setup and rigid in terms of scaling
			New selenium grid comes with docker support. This will enable developers or testers to spin up the containers rather than setting up heavy virtual machines
			Grid in selenium 4 also comes with an enhanced user friendly GUI
		
	-> Upgraded selenium IDE
			Improved GUI for intuitive user experience
			Improved control flow mechanism that enables testers to write better "while" and "if" conditions
			The code for test cases recorded using selenium IDE can be exported in the desired language binding like Java,C#,Python, .Net and Javascript
			
	-> Relative locators in selenium 4
			Selenium 4 brings an easy way of locating elements with the inclusion of relative locators
				-> To Left Of
				-> To Right Of
				-> Above 
				-> Below
			No existing locator functionalities have been removed

	-> Support for chrome debugging protocol
			Selenium 4 comes with native support for chrome dev tools protocol
			This means QAs can now use chrome development properties like fetch, Network, Profiler, Performance, Application cache and more
			
	-> Better window/Tab management in selenium 4
			Limitations in Selenium 3
				In selenium 3 to handle mulitple windows, a new object with the webdriver has to be created and then window handlers are used to handle the new window. In selenium 4, the limitation is addressed and completely removed
				
				newWindow function that allows user to create and switch to a "NEW" window/tab without creating a new WebDriver object
					driver.switchTo().newWindow(WindowType.WINDOW);
					driver.switchTo().newWindow(WindowType.Tab);
			
	-> Modifications in the Actions class
			Limitations of Actions class in Selenium 3
				There were some limitation with drag and drop, double clicks and some other interactive actions
				
			Selenium 4 features upgrade
				- click(WebElement) : 
					This method is added to Actions class to replace the moveToElement(onElement).click()
					It is used to click on certain web element
				
				- clickAndHold(WebElement):
					This method  will replace the moveToElement(onElement).clickAndHold()
					It is used to click on an element without releasing the click
					
				- contextClick(WebElement)
					This method will replace moveToElement(onElement).contextClick()
					It will perform the right click operation
					
				- doubleClick(WebElement)
					This method is added to replace moveToElement(element).doubleClick()
					It will perform a double click on an element

=========================================================================================================================================
WebDriver [Important topic for interview]

	Selenium webdriver is a well designed object oriented API which helps in communication between languages and browsers
	Every browser has different logic of performing actions like loading a page, closing the browser etc
	Selenium makes it possible for programmer to communicate with browsers through webdriver
	
	Architecture of selenium webdriver
	
				C#      																					FireFox
		
				Java																						Chrome
		
[Bindings]		Python   <-------------->     Selenium webdriver      <-------------------->     [Drivers]	edge
		
				Ruby																						Opera
		
				Others
				
		Language Binding:
			To support multiple languages, selenium has developed language bindings
			
		Selenium WebDriver:
			It is an API which makes possible to communication between programming languages and browsers. It follows object oriented concepts. it has multiple classes and interfaces
			
		Browser drivers:
			A browser driver can be considered as a personal secretary of a boss. 
			A browser driver helps in communicating with browser without revealing the internal logic of browsers functionality.
			The browser driver is the same regardless of the language used for automation
			
	Working internal logic flow of a selenium script:[important Q]
		A http request is created  and sent to browser driver for each selenium instruction or commands
		A browser driver receives the http request through http server
		http server decides all steps to perform instructions which are executed on browser.
		Execution status is sent back to http server which is sent back to automation script
	
		

	Q1. WebDriver is a class or interface?
		Webdriver is interface in Java. Chromedriver, safaridriver,geckodriver are the class which actually implements the webdriver

	Q2. Difference btwn close() and quit() methods
		Close() : This method closes the currently open browser window or the browser window which is in focus. 
		Quit() : This method is used to close all the open instances of browser opened by selenium
	
		The other difference is that the driver invoked will not be closed with close() as it will close only the current browser window and the process will be running in background though the browser is closed. The quit() method will close the invoked driver as well along with the browser instances opened using selenium
	
=========================================================================================================================================	
Options Class:
	Options class are used to set the browser preferences and Browser Settings.
	ChromeOptions(), FireFoxOptions(), etc.,
		
	FireFoxOptions(): FirefoxOptions() class set all the options specific to the execution of the session.
	ChromeOptions(): ChromeOptions() class set all the options specific to the execution of the session.
		
	Using Browser Options class we can set options like make the browser headless, load extensions, set binaries and set proxy so on.
		
	Methods of Options Class
		setBinary(): 
			This is used to provide the binary exe path of Browser. This method is used whenever tester want to perform the browser version testing in selenium
				
		setAcceptInsecureCerts(): 
			This is used to bypass the authentication certificate or SSL certificate to test the website. This method accepts boolean parameter, if true driver accepts the certificate and proceeds further, if false is passed and site has SSL then driver will stop the execution as it cannot process further due to SSL.
				
		setProxy(): 
			To set Proxy we have Proxy Class in Selenium. We need to set the proxy and pass the Proxy Object in setProxy() method.
				
		setHeadLess(): 
			Headless means no UI. Selenium helps user to run the Tests in headless browser and make the Browser HeadLess.
				eg:
					FirefoxOptions fo = new FirefoxOptions();
					fo.setHeadless(true);		
		
		
		addArguments(): 
			This method is used when user wants to open the Browser with some specific permissions. 
			Like : disable Infobar(eg: Chrome is running by automated software), Manage Browser Notifications(like pop up on the left saying know your location, wants to send notification, pop up disabled which has allow & block options)
				eg:
					ChromeOptions co = new ChromeOptions();
					co.addArguments("--disable-infobars");
					co.addArguments("--disable-notifications");
					WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(co);
				
		setUnhandledPromptBehaviour(): 
			This method helps the user to handle the un handled alert, when we dont know when a javascript alert pop ups this method can be used
				eg:
					ChromeOptions co = new ChromeOptions();
					co.setUnhandledPromptBehaviour(UnexpectedAlertBehaviour.ACCEPT);
					WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(co);
				
			
		setPageLoadStrategy(): 
			This is used when page load takes much time. 
			Three type page load strategy: Normal,Eager,None
			
			Strategy Ready State	Notes
			normal	 complete	    Used by default, waits for all resources to download
			eager	 interactive	DOM access is ready, but other resources like images may still be loading
			none	 Any	        Does not block WebDriver at all
			
			eg:
				ChromeOptions co = new ChromeOptions();
				co.setPageLoadStrategy(PageLoadStrategy.EAGER);
				WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(co);
=========================================================================================================================================	
WebElement:
	Anything present on the webpage such as textbox,text, button, link, table,radio button, checkbox etc are called as webelement
	
	Importance of webelement in selenium:
		Without webelement it is impossible to automate the functionality in a webpage
	
	The object we used to identify and work on web-element is called locator
	Webelement is an interface same as webdriver
	WebElement can be created by findElement() and findElements() method of webdriver
	
Locators:
	Selenium uses locators to find and match the elements of the page that it needs to interact with
	In selenium we have 8 type of locators
		ID
		name
		className
		tagName
		linkText
		partialLinkText
		cssSelector
		xpath
		
	Priority of locator on selenium
		id > name > className > cssSelector > xpath
		
	To find the locator user need to open the developer tools of browser
	
FindElement:
	findElement() is method in selenium, used to identify the web-element with the help of 'By' class
	This method is used to find the single element on the web-page
	This method returns the first matching element of the specified locators
	It throws NoSuchElementException when fails to locate the element
	Find element will not work with elements which are present in HTML frames
		
FindElements:
	findElements() method which can return multiple elements matching with the given locator, findElements() returns List<WebElement>
	findElements() provide the whole list of all the elements matching the specified locator
	It the element doesnt exist or not available on the page then, the return value will be an empty list
	It will not throw "NoSuchElementException" in case of element not present
		
=========================================================================================================================================

Xpath & CSS selectors	
	
	Q1. Can single webelement have 2 path?[Important]
		Yes,it is possible
		//input[@id='nickname']
		//*[@id='gb']/div[2]/div[3]/div[1]/div/div[1]/a
		
	Q2. Can 2 web elements have same xpath?[Important]
		Yes. It is possible. 
			eg : //a - there can be multiple tags that can be found with the a tag
	
	Q3. How can you verify the xpath genrated for a element is correct?
			Open developer option by pressing f12 on broswer and click ctrl+f and enter the xpath value and verify that the xpath is highlighting right element 
	
=========================================================================================================================================	
Waits in selenium
	Waits are necessary to capture the web application reaction.
	Waits are helpful when page have the Ajax calls
	Waits help user to create the stable automation
	
	Timeout Interface in selenium
		- Timeout is interface in webdriver interface, which manages all waits of webdriver instances
		- We are declaring the timeout in the instance of webdriver and not on the process. So if we define the timeout with a webdriver instance it is applicable throughout the script. So we dont have to mention it again and again on the scrip like thread.sleep
		- There is no implementation present for these methods in Timeouts interface, the browser classes(FireFox driver, chromeDriver,..) provides the implementations for these methods because browser classes implements webdriver interface
		- one time putting wait is enough here as long as driver is not killed
		
		Timeout interface has three abstract methods
			implicitlyWait
			setScriptTimeOut
			pageLoadTimeOut
	
	Types of wait in selenium 3:
		-> Sleep
			Sleep() is a method present in thread class
			Thread.sleep will halt the process thread for the hardcoded timeframe even if the next action webelement is available
			we have to mention thread.sleep each time when we want to put a wait between the code/action
			
		-> pageLoadTimeOut
			Page load Timeout in selenium requests/set the time limit for a page to load
			If page is not loaded within the given time frame selenium throws TimeOutException
			one time putting wait is enough here as long as driver is not killed 
			if the pageload timeout in -ve it means giving infinite time
			page load timeout is useful when we perform performance test, or when we test execution in IE
				eg : driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
	
	How do you give infinite wait time?
		if the pageload timeout is in -ve it means giving infinite time
			
		-> setScriptTimeOut
			setScriptTimeOut sets the time limit for asynchronous script to finish execution
			The setScriptTimeOut method affects only javascript code
			If process is not completed within the given time frame selenium throws TimeOutException
			
			Why we need setScriptTimeOut?
				The default timeout set for setScriptTimeOut method is 0(Zero), if we dont set any time, our executeAsyncScript method may fail because the javascript code may take more than zero seconds. So to avoid unnecessary failures we have to set the setScriptTimeOut
			
			
		-> Implicit Wait in selenium
			The implicit wait will tell the web driver to wait for certain amount of time before it throws "No such element exeception"
			Default wait time of the selenium is 500 milli seconds, implicit wait overrides the default wait time of the selenium webdriver
			If element is found before implictly wait time, selenium moves to next commands in the program without waiting to complete the implicitlyWait time
			one time putting wait is enough here as long as driver is not killed 
			if the driver is not able to find out the web element within the limit of implicit wait then it will throw "No such element exeception"
				eg: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(2,TimeUnit.SECONDS);
			
			
		-> ExplicitWait
			The explicit wait is used to tell the web driver to wait for certain conditions (Excepted conditions) or the maximum time exceeded before throwing an "ElementNotVisibleException" exception
			Explicit wait will be applicable for only one line (one condition) we have to use it with ExpectedConditions class
			WebDriverWait by default calls the expected condition every 500 milliseconds until it returns successfully
			Expected condition will not impact findElement() and findElements() in selenium
			
			Expected conditions present in Explicit wait:
				- alertIsPresent()
				- elementSelectionStateToBe(locator,selected)
				- elementToBeClickable(locator)
				- elementToBeSelected(locator)
				- frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt(locator)
				- presenceOfElementLocated(locator)
				- textToBePresentInElement(locator,text)
				- title()
				- titles(title)
				- visibilityOf(Element)
				
				eg:
					WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 30);
					wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent());
				
		-> FluentWait
			Fluent Wait in Selenium marks the maximum amount of time for Selenium WebDriver to wait for a certain condition (web element) becomes visible. It also defines how frequently WebDriver will check if the condition appears before throwing the “ElementNotVisibleException”.
			
			To put it simply, Fluent Wait looks for a web element repeatedly at regular intervals until timeout happens or until the object is found.
			
			example:
				//Declare and initialise a fluent wait
					FluentWait wait = new FluentWait(driver);
				//Specify the timout of the wait
					wait.withTimeout(5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
				//Sepcify polling time
					wait.pollingEvery(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
				//Specify what exceptions to ignore
					wait.ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class)

				//This is how we specify the condition to wait on.
					wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent());
	
	
	
	Waits and Timeout in selenium 4: [important]
		Selenium 3 wait methods are deprecated in selenium 4
		In selenium 4, the parameters received in Waits and Timeout have changed from expecting(long Time, TimeUnit unit) to expect(Duration duration)
		
		Implicit wait
			selenium 3:
				driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS);
				
			selenium 4:
				driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
				
		Explicit wait
			selenium 3:
				WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,10);
				
			selenium 4:
				WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
				
=========================================================================================================================================	
Get Text
	How can we extract the text from webWebelement
		Text of link /paragraph / Heading
		Text of place holder
		
	eg:
		//to get the text of button
		System.out.println(driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[@name = 'login']")).getText());
	
getAttribute()
	getAttribute method is used to extract the text value of an attribute from a HTML tag
	Text of place holder can be extracted using getAttribute
	
		webelement.getAttribute(“AttributeName") -> To print the attribute value in the web element
		webelement.getAttribute(“value”) -> To print the values we have passed in text box
	eg:
		//to get a placeholder text //get attribute works on webElement
		System.out.println(driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@id = 'pass']")).getAttribute("placeholder"));
		
		
sendKeys in selenium
	To enter text in a field
	eg:
		driver.findElement(By.name("q")).sendKeys("Selenium");

Handle keyboard keys
	To perform the action of key pressed in keyboard
		eg:
			driver.findElement(By.id("userpass")).sendKeys(Keys.ENTER);
			
How to empty a field:
	driver.findElement(By.id("create")).clear();
	
How to perfrom right click?
	Actions a = new Actions(WebDriver ref name); 
	a.contextClick(WebElement); 
		
How to find broken links using selenium?
	What is broken link?
		Link is pointing to the wrong URL or on click which renders the user on 404 page not found error
	
	we can verify the broken links in two ways
		Click link and verify the URL redirection
		Click link and verify status code
		
How to handle frame and iFrames?
	Frames/iFrames are attribute of HTML
	iFrames are used in HTML to divide the webpage in blocks
	code/elements inside the iFrames are not accesible by the main page source
	Elements present in iFrames cant be extracted from webpage directly, it means defining a HTML page inside a HTML page
	To work with iFrames, first we need to switch selenium focus into iFrame
	We can handle frames/iFrames present in the webpage using drivers.switchTo() command in webdriver
	Look at the DOM structure of a page that contains an iFrame you will never be able to find inner content of iFrame. And you wont be able to interact with it via the DOM
		
		driver.switchTo().frame(String id) -  To switch into frame
		driver.switchTo().frame(String name) - To switch into frame
		driver.switchTo().frame(webelement) - To switch into frame
		
	How to identify the iFrame is there are not?
		We can identify iFrame by ID, name, element and index
			driver.switchTo().frame("//iframe[@id = 'id_value']");
		
		if frame does not have id or name we use xpath as follows
			driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElement(By.xpath("//iframe[@class = 'demo-frame']")));
			
		defaultContent(); 
			in selenium it helps to switch the context to top most frame which is main page
			driver.switchTo().defaultContent();
			
		Difference between driver.switchTo().parentFrame() and driver.switchTo().defaultContent()? [Important question]
			driver.switchTo().defaultContent();
				This will pass the control to the main document which contains the iframes

			driver.switchTo().parentFrame();
				This will pass the control to the imminent parent frame of the current frame
		
			Example::
				main body
				{
				frame1
				{
				frame2
				frame3 (we are here currently)
				}
				}
			Now using driver.switchTo().defaultContent(); will pass the control to main body
			And using driver.switchTo().parentFrame(); will pass the control to frame1.
			
	
Verify visibility of web-element on web page
	isDisplayed()
		It is the method used to verify presence of web element within the webpage
		Returns 'true' if element is displayed or false element is missing on web page
		
Verify link/webelement is enabled on webpage
	isEnabled()
		It is the method to verify if the web element is enabled or disabled within the webpage
		Returns 'true' if element is enabled or false element is not enabled on web page

Verify element is selected on webpage		
	isSelected()
		It is the method used to verify if the web element is selected or not
		isSelected() method is predominantly used with radio buttons, drop down and check boxes
		Returns 'true' if element is selected or false element is not selected on web page
		
Select class
	Selenium webdriver provides Select class, with the help of select class we can handle drop downs on the webpage
	
	Steps to select a valus in dropdown in selenium webdriver
		1. Find the dropdown using findElement
		2. Create object for Select class passing dropdown element as parameter
		3. Select the value from the dropdown values
		
	There are two type of dropdowns
		- single value dropdown
		- Multiple value dropdown
		
	Methods in select class:
		- selectByIndex(int Index)
		- selectByValue(String value)
		- selectByVisibleText(String text)
		- getOptions()
		- getFirstSelectedOption()
		- getAllSelectedOption()
		- isMultiple()   - to check if the drop down accepts multiple selection. Returns true or false
		- deSelectByIndex(int Index)
		- deSelectByValue(String Value)
		- deSelectByVisibleText(String text)
		- deSelectAll()
		
		eg: 
			WebElement monthDropDown = driver.findElement(By.name("birthday_month"));
			//selectByIndex(int index)
			Select select = new Select(monthDropDown);
			select.selectByIndex(11);
		
Handle multiple Browser windows/Tab
	In selenium, we need to switch to window/tab on which we want to work
	Selenium provides native support to handle multiple windows
	Selenium use GUID to identify the application and work on it
	
	driver.switchTo().window(String URL)
	driver.switchTo().window(String title)
	driver.switchTo().window(Window ID)
	
	Methods to work with Multiple windows:
		getWindowHandle() - will get the GUID of the tab
		getWindowHandles()
		switchTo().window()
		
		eg:
			Set<String> windowId = driver.getWindowHandles();
		
			System.out.println(windowId.size());
		
			Iterator<String> itr = windowId.iterator();
		
			String mainPageId = itr.next();
			String secondPageId = itr.next();
			System.out.println(mainPageId);
			System.out.println(secondPageId);
		
			//Switching to the second page
			driver.switchTo().window(secondPageId);
			
			//To switch to parent window
			driver.switchTo().defaultContent();
		
Handle alerts 
	Alerts in webpage used to get the attention of user
	Alerts are formed using javascript inside the HTML page
	
	Properties of alert:
		We cannot identify alerts using inspect tools
		We cannot write xpaths for alerts
		when alert is present on webpage we cannot proceed further without handling the pop up/alert
		
	Alerts can be handled using switchTo().alert() method present in selenium
	
	we can perform below actions on Alerts
		Accept the alert
		Dismiss the alert
		Get text present on alert
		Send text to prompt of alert
		
	eg:
		Alert alt = driver.switchTo().alert();
		alt.accept();
		
	GetText from alert without using getText method
		JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor)driver;
		String text = js.executeScript("return window.alert.myAlertText;");
		System.out.println(text);


		
		
Handle Mouse & keyboard events in selenium - Actions class
	Actions class in selenium supports to perform all the operations related with mouse and keyboard
	Actions class will not help to switch window/tab like we can do with ctrl+tab key
	Whenever Actions methods takes place we use or end that method with perform() to perform that method.
	If we use one method to perform we use perform();
	If we use more than one method in one line of code we use buid().perform();
	
	Builder pattern:
		Builder pattern is used to build the composite pattern to perform some action. In action class that can be completed by build() method
		This means that we can build up a nice sequence of operations, for example, "Press shift key and type something and then release"
		
	Handle Mouse Hover:	
		Actions action = new Actions(driver);
		action.moveToElement(courseLink).build().perform();
	
	Handle Drag and drop:
		
		To drag and drop when we have elements for source and target
			Actions action = new Actions(driver);
			action.dragAndDrop(src, trgt).build().perform();
		
		To drag and drop when we dont have elements target
			Actions action = new Actions(driver);
			action.dragAndDropBy(dragAble, 10, 20).build().perform();
		
		How to drag and drop without using drag and drop method[important]
			WebElement src = driver.findElement(By.id("draggable"));
			WebElement trgt = driver.findElement(By.id("droppable"));
			Actions action = new Actions(driver);
			action.clickAndHold(src).moveToElement(trgt).release(trgt).build().perform();
			
		action.moveByOffset(xOffset,yOffset).build().perform(); - method is used to move the mouse from its current position to another point on the web page
		
	How to handle Keyboard shortcuts [important]
		Actions action =  new Actions(driver)
              action.keyDown(Keys.SHIFT)
                .sendKeys("a")
                .keyUp(Keys.SHIFT)
                .sendKeys("b")
                .perform();
				
		Keydown - Press key
		keyup - Release key
		
	
	
Handle webTables:
	What is webtable
		Webtable is table of rows and columns in HTML
		 tr -> table rows th -> table header td-> table columns table -> table
		Using list of webelements and entering the right xpath we can fetch the desired value at ease with webtable
		
Handle Ajax auto suggestion
	Put thread.sleep() so the elements will load and get the webelement list. Using the list we can work on the element auto suggested
	

Javascript executor:
	Javascript:
		Javascript is used to make the website interactive
		Javascript can change the content of the html page dynamically
	Javascript executor:
		It allows you to run pure Javascript code irrespective of the selenium language binding(java, c#, python) you are using
		JavascriptExecutor is an interface which have two methods
			executeScript()
			executeAsyncScript()
		If selenium is not able to perform a action in webpage then javascript executor can help in that case
		Typecast the driver object into javascript executor, then we can perform any webpage action
	
		
	use javascript executor for some operations like 
		- open website
			eg: 
				JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
				js.executeScript("window.location = 'https://www.rediff.com/'");
				
		- verify page loaded completely
			eg:	String pageTitle = (String)js.executeScript("return document.title");
				
		- Type text with javascript executor
			eg:
				js.executeScript("arguments[0].value = 'abc@xyz.com'", userName);.
				
				
		- Click via js executor
			eg:
				WebElement signinBtn = driver.findElement(By.linkText("Sign in"));
				js.executeScript("arguments[0].click()", signinBtn)
				
		- Scroll the page via JS executor
			eg:
				js.executeScript("window.scrollBy(0,3000)");
				
		- Scroll to particular webElement
			eg:
				js.executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true)", webElement);
				
		- Highlight the element on webpage
			js.executeScript("arguments[0].setAttribute('style','background:yellow')",textHighlight);
		
		- to check the page is completely loaded using js
			eg:
				JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
				String pageState = (String) js.executeScript("return document.readyState;");
				
		- to check the js of the page loads
			eg:
				Boolean jsState = (Boolean) js.executeScript("return window.jQuery != undefined && jQuery.active ==0;");
	
		-GetText from alert without using getText method
			JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor)driver;
			String text = js.executeScript("return window.alert.myAlertText;");
			System.out.println(text);
		
	How to scroll using js executor?
		JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor)driver;
		js.executeScript("window.location = 'https://www.rediff.com/'");
		js.executeScript("window.scrollBy(0,3000)");
		js.executeScript("window.scrollBy(0,document.body.scrollHeight)");
		
		-> arguments[0].setAttribute('value','input txt') - To pass any input text in textbox
		-> return arguments[0].getAttribute('value') - Retrieve the values of user entered text
		-> arguments[0].click() - For button click
		-> arguments[0].scrollIntoView(false) - Scroll down
		-> arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true) - Scroll up
	
	Other methods to scroll
	Scroll by
	scrollto
	ScrollIntoView
	MoveToElement
	sendKeys(Keys.pageDown)
	
File upload in selenium
	Selenium cannot interact with OS, so with the help of sendKeys method we can send in the filepath which will upload the file
	
=========================================================================================================================================
Justify selenium webdriver is interface not a class
		 Object cannot be instantiated for interface
		 And interface methods does not have any body
		 
Retry only failed tests in Automation
	
	Method 1: testng-failed.XML in test-output directory
		TestNG will automatically create the testing-failed XML with the failed test cases. We can run the XML and run the failed tests alone
	
	Method 2: attach retry Analyzer with the retry mechanism implemented class using testNG


Execute test in microsoft edge
	using edge driver we can automate similar to chrome driver.
	But execution on edge is not much preferred as it is quite unstable and lots of times it cannot identify the locators
	
==================================================================================================================================
driver.get(URL) Vs driver.navigate().to("URL")
	
	driver.get(URL)
		It is responsible for loading the page and waits until the page has finished loading.
		It cannot track the history of the browser.
		In single page applications get() refreshes page.
		
	driver.navigate().to(URL)
		It is only responsible for redirecting the page and then returning immediately.
		It maintains the browser history and cookies, so we can use forward and backward button to navigate between the pages.
		In single page applications while navigate().to() navigates to the page by changing URL like doing forward/backward
	
	 
/to get the url of the current page
	String url = driver.getCurrentUrl();

Take screenshot:
	TakesScreenshot takeScreenShot = (TakesScreenshot) driver;
	File sourceFile = takeScreenShot.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
	File destFile = new File(System.getProperty("user.dir") + "\\Screenshots\\" + DateUtils.getTimeStamp() + ".png");
	FileUtils.copyFile(sourceFile, destFile);
	
	
How to get CSS values using selenium
	Disadvantage of getAttribute
		we cannot get value of each attribute separately using getAttribute()
		eg:
			<p style="color:green;font-size:24px;">Green tech</p>
			
			->Style attribute is way of declaring CSS properties of HTML element
			-> Each attribute has a name and value separated by colon(:)
			-> Each property declaration is separated by semicolon (;)
			
			webElement element = driver.findElement(By.xpath(//p[text() = 'Green Tech']))
			sysout(element.getAttribute("style"));
			
			output: color:green;font-size:24px;
				
		instead we can use getCssValue();
			eg: system.out.println(element.getCssValue("color"));             // 400
				system.out.println(element.getCssValue("font-weight"));       //rgba(28,30,33,1)
				system.out.println(element.getCssValue("font-size"));		  //12px
				system.out.println(element.getCssValue("background-color"));  //rgba(255,255,255,1)
				system.out.println(element.getCssValue("text-align"));		  //center
				
How to capture width and height of an element
	Point point = element.getLocation();
	int elementWidth = element.getSize().getWidth();
	int elementHeight = element.getSize().getHeight();
	
getLocation() method
	This is used to get the relative position of an element where it is rendered on the web page. This position is calculated relative to the top-left corner of the web page of which the (x, y) coordinates are assumed to be (0, 0).
		eg: Point point = element.getLocation();
		
		eg2:
			WebElement elem = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.name("q")));
			System.out.println("X coordinate is: "+elem.getLocation().getX());
			System.out.println("Y coordinate is: "+elem.getLocation().getY());

			
Switch tab without using SwitchTo().window() (or) open an empty tab in browser
	
	Actions action =  new Actions(driver)
              action.keyDown(Keys.CONTROL)
                .keyDown(Keys.TAB)
                .keyUp(Keys.CONTROL)
                .keyUp(Keys.TAB)
                .perform();
				
				(or)

	Robot r = new Robot();        
			r.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);
			r.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_T);
			r.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);
			r.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_T);
	
	To switch tab use ctrl + Tab
	With each switch of tab or window, get the page title and confirm the page you've switched to
