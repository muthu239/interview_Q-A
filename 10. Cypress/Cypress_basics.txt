What is cypress?
	Cypress is a next generation front end automation testing tool built for the modern web applications
	
How cypress is unique from other automation tools?
	Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. By default Cypress has a timeout of 4 seconds.
	Ability to test edge testcases by mocking the server response of APIs
	Cypress takes snapshots as your test runs. We can hover over each commands in the command log to see exactly what happened at each step.
	Because of its architectural design, cypress delivers fast, consistent and reliable test execution compared to other automation tools
	View videos of your entire tests execution when run from the cypress dashboard
	
	Cypress is built on Node.js and comes packaged as npm module
	As it is built on Node.Js, it uses javascript for writing tests. But 90% of coding can be done using cypress inbuit commands.\
	Cypress also bundles with JQuery and inherits many of JQuery methods for UI components identification

Cypress Vs Selenium[Important]?

======================================================================================================================================
Cypress architecture
	Most testing tools (Like selenium) operate by running outside of the browser and executing remote commands across the network. 
	But cypress engine directly operates inside the browser. In other words, it is the browser that is executing your test code
	This enables cypress to listen and modify the browser behavior at run time by manipulating DOM and altering network requests and responses on the fly.
	Cypress open doors to New Kind of testing having ultimate control over your application
	
Cypress components
	Test runner
	Dashboard services
