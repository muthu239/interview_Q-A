Project -> Test Suite -> Test case -> Test step

Groovy script in SoapUi
	Script is invoked with log, context and testRunner variables
	
Log variable
	Log variable is basically used to print any text or print any variable/value into our console.
	
Context variable
	Context variable is used to access and modify the variables and properties of our test case.
	Scope of the context lies in the Test Case only
	Properties outside of test cases level cannot be accessed using context variable
	
Testrunner variable
	Testrunner variable is used to access any variable and properties at any level of the project
	
Note: TO access any property using testRunner you have to come through its parent only - rule
	eg: testRunner.testCase.testSuite.testCases["getEmployee"].getPropertyValue("id")
	
	control flow based on above code is:
		testRunner i.e)Test Step -> testcase i.e)Script -> testSuite i.e)Testing -> testCases i.e)all 3 test case and we are mentioning which test case we want -> getproperty of that test case
		
Important interview question:
	How do you access property from different test cases?
		with testRunner variable we case traverse throughout the script and get the property as required
