Json
[] - arrays/Indexes
{} - Objects

In Json we'll traverse through objects. whereas in XML we'll traverse through nodes

to traverse through json below are the ways
	1.parentObject.childObject
	2.parentObject.childObject[index]   -> to use when we know the index of the object
	3.parentObject.childObject[?(@.object=='Value')].siblingToChildobject  -> to use when the indexes are dynamic and to get the sibling of the object searched

How to deal when indexes are dynamic?
Syntax :
photos.photo[?(@.object=='Value')].object
? -> for regular expression 

photos.photo[?(@.title == 'Altona North')].id
the above will search for through the index for the title and grab the id of the title
