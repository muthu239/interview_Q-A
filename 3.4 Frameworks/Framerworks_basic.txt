Automation Framework:
	Automation framework is not a single tool or process, but it is a collection of tools and processes working together to support automated testing of any application. It integrates various functions like libraries, test data and various reusable models

Why automation Test framework is required?
	Maintain a well defined strategy across the test suites
	Enhanced speed at which testing progresses
	Maintaining the test code will be easy
	The URL or Application can be tested accurately
	Continuous testing of coding and delivery will be achieved
	
Types of automation framework
	- Linear automation framework (Tools which support record and playback follows this approach)
	- Modular driven framework (Spliting the code as modules and not based on application eg:, current UiPath project)
	- Behaviour driven framework (eg: cucumber)
	- Data driven framework (test data will basically drive the automation)
	- Keyword driven framework
	- Hybrid testing framework (Mixing of two or more frameworks)
	
TDD(Test driven development)
		Only developer or tester can understand the implementation as its purely technical language. 
		eg: TestNG
		Data driven Framework, POM all falls under this category
		


Reports
Types of reports
Reports in java selenium

What is selenium Framework?
	Selenium framework is a code structure for making code maintenance simpler and code readability better
	A framework involves breaking the entire code into smaller pieces of code, which test a particular functionality
	
Data driven framework:
	A data driven framework in selenium is the technique of separating the "data set" from the actual "test case" (code)
	We need to design a single test case for all scenarios and we will keep the test data in a separate file. From the file we will pass the data to the test case and the test case will iterate over the data present in the file.
	Data might vary each time test is executed but the code will not
	We will read the data from Excel file with third party library  Apache POI
	
	Requirement for DD framework:
		- Project building tool -> maven
		- Test execution tool -> TestNG
		- Read data from excel files -> Apache POI
		- Generate report -> Extent report
		
	Selenium does not contain report utility
	
	Selenium code I developed have,
		Test data - Excel - Apache POI
		Locators - Properties File 
		Build tool - Maven
		Test execution - TestNG
		Report - Extent report
		Logger - Extent logger(belongs to Extent report)
		Assert - Soft Assert is used
		Screenshot - Screenshots are taken on Failure using the method created
		BaseUI class - Containing commmon methods of UI functionalities
		
Soft Assert Vs Hard assert	
============================================================================================================================
What is Page object Model Framework
	Page Object Model is a design pattern to create object repository for webUI elements
	In POM, page class will find the webElements of that webpage and also contains page methods which perform operations on those web elements
	
Why POM?
	Page object pattern says operations and flows in the UI should be separated from verification. This concept makes the code cleaner and easy to understand.
	The second benefit is the object repository is independent of test cases, so we can use the same object repository for a different purpose with different tests
	Methods get more relaistic names which can be easily mapped with the operation happening in UI
	
What is page Factory?
	'Page object model' is way of representing an application in a test framework
	'Page Factory' is one way of implementing the 'Page Object Model' by initializing the web elements you want to interact with within the page Object when you create an instance of it.
	
The implementation would be like when you are performing some operation which will redirect you to a new page then that particular operation should create the object of the new page and return it

In this particular implementation if particular operation is not navigating you on a new page, then this will not return anything or this will return something
But if a particular function is redirecting you to a new page, then that function must return the object of the new page class

At runtime it will return null pointer exception if it cannot find the object

Challenges with POM
	How driver instances will be shared? - Resolved with help of pageFactory
	How to handle the common functions?
	What should be return type of fucntion?
	How to handle common web Elements?
		
		
@FindBy and pageFactory are part of selenium packagae
============================================================================================================================
What is Extent report?
	Extent is open source library for rich HTML reporting for TestNG tests.
	Extent Report have very rich UI with pie charts and details logs options
	
Why use TestNG with extent report?
	TestNG by default creates some reporting, using that particular reporting, extent report works with that by creating a far more optimised report
	
===============================================================================================================================
Why screenshots is required?
	To make debugging easy and to pinpoint the failure reason Screenshot are helpful


===============================================================================================================================
Common good practices on Automation
	Always make sure to generalize the code and data inputs and configs. So if required that can be changed in one place only.
	Maintain Configuration separately. 
	Maintain data required from user separate excel sheet
	Always maintain one Excel workboobk for datasheet. The workbook can have multiple sheets. But try to generalize the test sheet as well
	Capture screenshots on failures
	Always use try catch to catch the exceptions and put that in the report along with screenshots
	Maintain log on each function, step, UIelement. So for traceing back it'll be helpful in case of errors
	Always put yourself in the shoes of user. That will give a clear perspective.
	Generalise the code as much as possible as reusable code
