Note:
	-> Methods should be inside a class only. they cannot exist outside a class

Interview question (Important):
	Why Java is platform independent?
		Source code ->Compiler -> Byte code -> Execution -> Java Virtual machine(JVM) -> Output

Types of variable:
	Local variable:
		Variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable.
		You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.
		
	Instance or Class variable:
		A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called instance variable.
	
	Static variable:
		A variable which is declared as static is called static variable. It cannot be local
	

Primitive Vs Non Primitive Data type

Arrays
	Arrays is a collection of similar type of elements

Strings
	String is a sequence of characters. But in jave string is an object that represents a sequence of characters
	String is a class in java
	
	Why Java strings are immutable?(Important)
	
	
	String Vs String Buffer
	String Buffer Vs String Builder

OOPS Basics
	Class
	Object
	Inheritance
	Polymorphism	
	Abstraction
	Encapsulation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Constructor
	Types of constructor
		Default constructor
		Paramterized constructor
	
	Rules for creating Java Constructor
		Constructor name must be the same as its class name
		A constructor must have no explicit return type
		A java constructor cannot be abstract, final, static
		
	Is constructor overloading possible?
		Yes
		
		
Constructor Vs Method
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Static keyword
	Static members of class belongs to class itself instead of Class object
	
	Static variable:
		The static variable can be used to refer to the common property of all objects
		The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This keyword
	This is a reference variable that refers to the current object.
	
	
	Usage of this keyword in java
		-> this can be used to refer current class instance variable
		-> this can be used to invoke current class method(implicitly)
		-> this() can be used to invoke current class constructor
		-> this can be passed as an argument in method call
		-> this can be passed as an argumen in constructor call
		-> this can be used to return the current class instance from the method
		
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inheritance

	can we overload Java main() method?
	Types of inheritance:
		Single
		Multilevel
		Hierarchical
	
	Why mulitple inheritance is not possible in java?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polymorphism
	Runtime Ploymorphism(Method overriding) Vs Compile time polymorphism(Method Overloading)
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Super Keyword
	Super keyword is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object
	
	Usage of java Super keyword
		-> super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable
		-> super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method
		-> super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor
		
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final keyword
	Final keyword in java is used to restrict user. Variable,method and class can be defined final
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract class
	Class which is declared with abstract keyword is known as abstract class. It can have abstract and non abstract methods
	Abstract methods are methods without implementation
	Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details of showing only functionality to the user. Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
	Abstract class needs to be extended and its method implemented. Abstract class cannot be instantiated
	
Why abstract class cannot be instantiated?
	As the methods in abstract class are not implemented methods, there is no point in creating object for that class
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interface
	Interface is used to achieve 100% abstraction in java
	All variable declared in interface should be constant i.e) public static final
	you cant create the object of Interface
	An interface is declared by using the interface keyword
	An interface can extend another java interface only
	
Abstract class Vs Interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Encapsulation
	Process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit
	user can create a fully encapsulated class in java by making all the data members of the class private. And use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exception handling
	This is one of the powerful mechanism to handle runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application is maintained
	Exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow.
	
	Try:
		The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place exception code. 
		The try block must be followed by either catch or finally
		
	Catch:
		The "catch" block is used to handle the exception.
		It must be prceded by try block which means we cant use catch block alone
		
	Java try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. It must be used within the method.
	
	Multi catch:
		Application perfrm different taks at the occurence of different exceptions, use java multi catch block
		At a time only one exception is occured and at a time only one catch block is executed
		All catch block must be ordered from most specific to general
		
	Nested try:
		We can declare try inside the try and is called as nested try
		
	Finally:
		Java finally block is followed by try block and always executed whenever the execption occurs or not.
		Finally block is used to execute important code such as closing connection,stream etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collections
	Java collection framework
		A collection is a group of individual objects represented as a single unit. Java provides collection framework which defines several classes and interfaces to represent a group of objects as a single unit
		
Advantages of collection:
	Consistent API:
		The API has basic set of interfaces like collection, Set, List or Map. All those classes(such as ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector etc) which implements these interfaces have some common set of methods
	Reduces Programming effort:
		The programmer need not worry about design of collection rather than he can focus on its best use in his programmer
	Increases program speed and quality:
		Increases performance by providing high-performance implementations of useful data structures and algorithms
