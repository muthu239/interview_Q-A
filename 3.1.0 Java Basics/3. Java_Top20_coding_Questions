===================================================================
1. How to Handle AJAX Elements?
2. What is a fluent wait?
3. What is self-join?
4. Write a program to find the Fibonacci numbers using Recursion.
5. Write a program that gives O/p: a2b2c3d2 for the Input String Str=”aabbcccdd“. You must check all the conditions so the code can’t break.
6. Explain the internal architecture of HashMAP.
7. What are the Constraints in SQL?
8. Why did we use Maven?
9. How will you execute the scenario If you have 100 test scripts… if test case no. 61 passes, then don’t run/execute tests 62 to 67. 


1. Write a function to reverse a given string.
Example:
Input: Stringinput="hello";
Output: "olleh"

2. Explain the difference between findElement and findElements.
->findElement: Returns the first matching element on the current page.
findElements: Returns a list of all matching elements on the current page.

3. What is the purpose of the testing phase in SDLC?
->The testing phase ensures that the software product is free of defects and errors, meets the requirements, and is reliable and usable.

4. Explain method overloading and method overriding.
->Method Overloading: Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.
Method Overriding: A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

5. What is an abstract class?
->An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by subclasses.

6. Difference between PUT and POST
->PUT is like updating or replacing something, while POST is like adding something new.

7. If an element is getting displayed intermittently, how will write code such that no exceptions are to be thrown?
->To handle elements that are intermittently displayed and ensure no exceptions are thrown, you can use explicit waits in Selenium. Explicit waits allow you to wait for a specific condition to be met before proceeding with the next step in your code.
