API - Application programming interface
 API is an interface or communication protocol between a client and a server intended to simplify the building of client side software.
 
REST is a lightweight protocol
Representational State Transfer (REST) - JSON
HTTP protocol is followed for the request and response to and from an API

EndPoint/Base URI : Address where API is hosted on the server

HTTP methods which are commonly used to communicate with REST APIs are
CRUD operations - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

	-> GET
		The GET method is used to extract information from the given server using a given URI. While using GET request, it should only extract data and should have no other effect on the data. No Payload/Body required
		
		How to send input data in GET?
			Using Query Parameters
			
	-> POST
		A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.
			
		How to send input data in POST?
			Using Form Parameters /Body Payload
			
	-> PUT
		Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content
	
	-> DELETE
		Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI
		
	
Headers/Cookies:
	Headers represent the meta-data associated with the API request and response. In layman terms, we were sending additional details to API to process our request.
		Example: Content-type, Authorization details
		
Resources:
	Resources represent API/Collection which can be accessed from the server
		eg: Google.com/maps
			Google.com/Search
			
			google.com - server  maps - API
			
Path parameters:
	Path parameters are variable parts of a URL path. 
	They are typically used to point to a specific resource within a collection, such as user identified by ID
		eg: https://www.google.com/images/1122443
		
		1122443 - is the parameters
	
Query parameters:
	Query parameters is used to sort/filter the resources
	Query parameters are identified with ?""
	Each query paramter is separated by &
		eg: https://amazon.com/orders?sort_by=2/20/2020
		
End Point request URL can be constructed as below
	Base URL/resource/(Query/Path) Paramters
