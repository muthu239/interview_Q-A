Cucumber framework
	TDD(Test driven development)
		Based on test cases script is developed 
		Only developer and tester can understand the implementation. 
		eg: TestNG
		
	BDD (Behavior driven development)
		Gherkin language : 
			used by cucumber. To convert plain simple english language to interact with application
			Its a feature language not programming language
		
		BDD is all about behavior
		BDD is not only for UI automation. It is a common framework and can be used with API automation as well
		In BDD, Tests are written in plain descriptive english type grammer
		
		
	Cucumber is available with java & Ruby
	Cucumber is a testing framework which supports BDD
	It lets us define application behavior in plain meaningful english text using a simple grammer defined by a language called gherkin.
	Cucumber itself is written in Ruby, but it can be used to "test" code written in Ruby or other languages including but not limited to Java, C# and python


Cucumber have 3 components
	1. Feature file
		Feature file should have .feature extension
		Feature file have all keywords (feature, Given, When, Then, And, *, As, But, Rule, Background, Scenario, Scenario Outline)
		Feature file contains scenario related to that feature
			Reference - https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/
	
		
	2. Step definition file
		In Step definition file, tester will use the test code
		Test code - Selenium + java + Annotations(cucumber annotations)
		TestNG annotations are not used here. Cucumber annotations will be used
		
	3. Test Runner
		Used to execute to Run your test cases
		Will use Junit to execute the code. Not TestNG
		Use to Run feature
		To generate report and output
		
	Cucumber Framework setup
		Create Maven project
		Add dependencies
			1. latest Junit
			2. Add cucumber dependencies
			3. Download eclipse Natural plug-in
			
			
	Cucumber feature implementation
		- Create feature in cucumber
				A single feature file can have multiple scenarios
		- Create scenario in cucumber
		- Define proper steps in feature file
		
	Step Definition implementation
		- Create step definition class
		- Implement the annotations
		- Define annotations. Annotations must have ^ at the beginning and $ at  the end
			eg: @Given("^Go to mycontactsform site$")
			
		 - if the feature file consists of "name", then in step definition we will declare the data Type
				eg: Then Verify Repo "name" is "API-TEST-REPO"
				
					@Then("Verify Repo {string} is {string}")
						public void verify_created_repo_name(String response_key, String repo_name) {}
						
		- if the feature file consists of "<name>" then keyword name is used, with scenario outline and examples we can provide varying data 
			
			
	Test runner
		Cucumber Options
			Cucumber options are like property file or setting for your test cases containg what you want to execute, where you want to execute and what is the basic criteria for execution

			Number of cucumber options available are:(Important interview questions)
				1. dryRun :  Checks if all the steps have step definition, will help in identifying the gap between step definition and feature file
				2. Features - The path of feature file
				3. Tags : What tags in the feature file should be executed
				4. Glue : The path of step definition file
				5. Monochrome : Display the console output in readable way (Will help in Command Line execution)
				6. Format : What all report format to use
				7. Strict : Will fail execution if there are pending steps
		
		All cucumber options must be defined in your test runner class
		"Tags" is the only cucumber option need to be defined in feature file
		
		dryRun :
			dryRun option can either set as true or false. If it is set as true, it means that cucumber will only checks that every step mentioned in the feature file have corresponding code written in step definition file or not
			So in case of any of the function is missed in the step definition for any step in Feature file, it will give us the message
			
		monochrome:
			This option can either set as true or false. If it is set as true, it means the console output for the cucumber test are much more readable. And if it is set as false, then the console output is not as readable as it should be
		
		Format:
			Format option is used to specify different formatting options for the output reports. Various options that can be used as formatters are:
				pretty : prints the gherkin source with additional colour and stack traces for errors
					eg: format = {"pretty"}
					
				HTML : This will generate a HTML report at the location mentioned in the formatter itself. 
					eg : format = {"html:Folder_name"}
					
				JSON : This report contains all the information from the gherkin source in JSON format. This report is meant to be post processed into another visual format by 3rd party tools such as cucumber jenkins.
					eg : format = {"json : Folder_name/File_name.json"}
				
				Junit : This report generate XML files just like Apache Ant's Junit report task. This XML format is understood by most continuous integration servers, who will use it to generate visual reports.
					eg : format = {"junit : Folder_name/File_name.xml"}
					
			
			
		Strict:
			Strict will verify the feature with the step definition file and it will mark your test case failed if any of the step or feature is in pending state or undefined
			 
		Tags:
			Tags are similar to groups in testNG.
			In testNG groups we used groups to combine test cases and groups.
			In cucumber we use tags to club the scenarios
				OR condition in tags : {"@Smoke, @E2E"} - Execute tests that contain either any one of the tags mentioned
				AND condition in tags : {"@Smoke", "@E2E"} - Execute tests that contains both the tags together
				
		
		Hooks:
			Hooks in cucumber is similar to AfterTest and BeforeTest annotations in testNG
			@Before and @After annotations of cucumber class
				
How can I run a pre requisite and post execution code?
	Using Hooks we can do that
		@Before("@Smoke") -> this will run only for smoke tests and before running the tests
			
			
			
	Disadvantage of cucumber
		The process of cucumber is very lengthy where we have to create the feature file which is lengthy, then the coressponding method and so on
		
=======================================================================================================================================
Data driven testing using Cucumber framework
	1. Simple Data driven - No use Examples keyword
	2. use Examples & Scenario outline Keyword
		Note: Withdry run = true, we can check if the values are passed correctly in the keywords correctly for all iterations
	3. Using DataTables
		If certain scenario need to run in loop and not using Examples keyword then use Maps to get the Key & value of dataTable 
		
		
=======================================================================================================================================		
Diff btwn Scenario & scenario outline
	Scenario outline is required if examples used


Notes:
	It is not required to create separate step definition file for each feature file		
	Cucumber is smart enough to find out the code in any java file in the stepdefinition package. So any java class the scenario may be created inside the package, cucumber will find it.
	No need for inheritance and all as the scenario can be written separately yet still the cucumber can call the correct scenario code
	No need for extent report. Cucumber has its own report
	
	
=======================================================================================================================================
cucumber reporting - for api
	We can add as a plugin in POM.XML and we can get the HTML and JSON report
	This report gives a details report of each step and how much time it took and where it failed
	very simple to add. And no need to do lot of work around it.

Deloitte interview questions
1. Purpose of Gherkin keywords(Given, when, then, And, but, *, ...) and where should you use that keyword
	https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/ - Go through this documentation fully
	
	
==================================================================================================================================
Gherkin basics
	
Gherkin uses a set of special keywords to give structure and meaning to executable specifications.

Comments:
	Comments are only permitted at the start of a new line, anywhere in the feature file. 
	They begin with zero or more spaces, followed by a hash sign (#) and some text.
	Block comments are currently not supported by Gherkin.
	
Note:
	Please note that some keywords are followed by a colon (:) and some are not. 
	If you add a colon after a keyword that should not be followed by one, your test(s) will be ignored.

Keywords:
	Each line that isn’t a blank line has to start with a Gherkin keyword, followed by any text you like. 	
	The only exceptions are the free-form descriptions placed underneath Example/Scenario, Background, Scenario Outline and Rule lines.

	The primary keywords are:
		Feature
		Rule (as of Gherkin 6)
		Example (or Scenario)
		Given, When, Then, And, But for steps (or *)
		Background
		Scenario Outline (or Scenario Template)
		Examples (or Scenarios)
	
	There are a few secondary keywords as well:
		""" (Doc Strings)
		| (Data Tables)
		@ (Tags)
		# (Comments)

Feature:
	The purpose of the Feature keyword is to provide a high-level description of a software feature, and to group related scenarios.
	The first primary keyword in a Gherkin document must always be Feature, followed by a : and a short text that describes the feature.
	You can add free-form text underneath Feature to add more description.
	These description lines are ignored by Cucumber at runtime, but are available for reporting (they are included by reporting tools like the official HTML formatter).
	The name and the optional description have no special meaning to Cucumber. Their purpose is to provide a place for you to document important aspects of the feature, such as a brief explanation and a list of business rules (general acceptance criteria).
	The free format description for Feature ends when you start a line with the keyword Background, Rule, Example or Scenario Outline (or their alias keywords).
	You can place tags above Feature to group related features, independent of your file and directory structure.
	You can only have a single Feature in a .feature file.
	
Descriptions:
	Free-form descriptions (as described above for Feature) can also be placed underneath Example/Scenario, Background, Scenario Outline and Rule.
	You can write anything you like, as long as no line starts with a keyword.
	Descriptions can be in the form of Markdown - formatters including the official HTML formatter support this.
	
	eg:
		Feature: Guess the word

		The word guess game is a turn-based game for two players.
		The Maker makes a word for the Breaker to guess. The game
		is over when the Breaker guesses the Maker's word.

		Example: Maker starts a game
	
	
Rule:
	The (optional) Rule keyword has been part of Gherkin since v6.
	The purpose of the Rule keyword is to represent one business rule that should be implemented. 
	It provides additional information for a feature. 
	A Rule is used to group together several scenarios that belong to this business rule. 
	A Rule should contain one or more scenarios that illustrate the particular rule.
	
	eg:
		Feature: Highlander

		  Rule: There can be only One

			Example: Only One -- More than one alive
			  Given there are 3 ninjas
			  And there are more than one ninja alive
			  When 2 ninjas meet, they will fight
			  Then one ninja dies (but not me)
			  And there is one ninja less alive

			Example: Only One -- One alive
			  Given there is only 1 ninja alive
			  Then he (or she) will live forever ;-)

		  Rule: There can be Two (in some cases)

			Example: Two -- Dead and Reborn as Phoenix
			  ...
			  
Example/Scenario:
	This is a concrete example that illustrates a business rule. It consists of a list of steps.
	The keyword Scenario is a synonym of the keyword Example.
	You can have as many steps as you like, but we recommend 3-5 steps per example. Having too many steps will cause the example to lose its expressive power as a specification and documentation.
	In addition to being a specification and documentation, an example is also a test. As a whole, your examples are an executable specification of the system.

	Examples follow this same pattern:
		Describe an initial context (Given steps)
		Describe an event (When steps)
		Describe an expected outcome (Then steps)
		
Steps:
	Each step starts with Given, When, Then, And, or But.
	Cucumber executes each step in a scenario one at a time, in the sequence you’ve written them in. When Cucumber tries to execute a step, it looks for a matching step definition to execute.
	Keywords are not taken into account when looking for a step definition. This means you cannot have a Given, When, Then, And or But step with the same text as another step
	
	eg:
		Cucumber considers the following steps duplicates:
			Given there is money in my account
			Then there is money in my account

Given:
	Given steps are used to describe the initial context of the system - the scene of the scenario. It is typically something that happened in the past.
	When Cucumber executes a Given step, it will configure the system to be in a well-defined state, such as creating and configuring objects or adding data to a test database.
	The purpose of Given steps is to put the system in a known state before the user (or external system) starts interacting with the system (in the When steps). Avoid talking about user interaction in Given’s. If you were creating use cases, Given’s would be your preconditions.
	It’s okay to have several Given steps (use And or But for number 2 and upwards to make it more readable).
	
When:
	When steps are used to describe an event, or an action. This can be a person interacting with the system, or it can be an event triggered by another system
	
Then:
	Then steps are used to describe an expected outcome, or result.
	The step definition of a Then step should use an assertion to compare the actual outcome (what the system actually does) to the expected outcome (what the step says the system is supposed to do).
	An outcome should be on an observable output. That is, something that comes out of the system (report, user interface, message), and not a behaviour deeply buried inside the system (like a record in a database).

And, But:
	If you have successive Given’s or Then’s, you could make the example more fluidly structured by replacing the successive Given’s or Then’s with And’s and But’s
	
	eg:
		Example: Multiple Givens
		  Given one thing
		  And another thing
		  And yet another thing
		  When I open my eyes
		  Then I should see something
		  But I shouldn't see something else
		  
*
	Gherkin also supports using an asterisk (*) in place of any of the normal step keywords. 
	This can be helpful when you have some steps that are effectively a list of things, so you can express it more like bullet points where otherwise the natural language of And etc might not read so elegantly.
	eg:
		Scenario: All done
		  Given I am out shopping
		  * I have eggs
		  * I have milk
		  * I have butter
		  When I check my list
		  Then I don't need anything
		  
Background:
	
	Occasionally you’ll find yourself repeating the same Given steps in all of the scenarios in a Feature.
	Since it is repeated in every scenario, this is an indication that those steps are not essential to describe the scenarios; they are incidental details. 
	You can literally move such Given steps to the background, by grouping them under a Background section.
	A Background allows you to add some context to the scenarios that follow it. 
	It can contain one or more Given steps, which are run before each scenario, but after any Before hooks.
	A Background is placed before the first Scenario/Example, at the same level of indentation.
	Background is also supported at the Rule level
	You can only have one set of Background steps per Feature or Rule. 
	If you need different Background steps for different scenarios, consider breaking up your set of scenarios into more Rules or more Features.

	For a less explicit alternative to Background, check out conditional hooks.
	
	eg:
		Feature: Multiple site support
		  Only blog owners can post to a blog, except administrators,
		  who can post to all blogs.

		  Background:
			Given a global administrator named "Greg"
			And a blog named "Greg's anti-tax rants"
			And a customer named "Dr. Bill"
			And a blog named "Expensive Therapy" owned by "Dr. Bill"

		  Scenario: Dr. Bill posts to his own blog
			Given I am logged in as Dr. Bill
			When I try to post to "Expensive Therapy"
			Then I should see "Your article was published."

		  Scenario: Dr. Bill tries to post to somebody else's blog, and fails
			Given I am logged in as Dr. Bill
			When I try to post to "Greg's anti-tax rants"
			Then I should see "Hey! That's not your blog!"
			
	Tips for using Background
		Don’t use Background to set up complicated states, unless that state is actually something the client needs to know
		Keep your Background section short
		Make your Background section vivid.
		Keep your scenarios short, and don’t have too many.
		
Scenario Outline/Scenario Template:
	The Scenario Outline keyword can be used to run the same Scenario multiple times, with different combinations of values.
	The keyword Scenario Template is a synonym of the keyword Scenario Outline.
	We can collapse these two similar scenarios into a Scenario Outline.
	Scenario outlines allow us to more concisely express these scenarios through the use of a template with < >-delimited parameters:

			
Examples/Scenarios:
	A Scenario Outline must contain one or more Examples (or Scenarios) section(s). 
	Its steps are interpreted as a template which is never directly run. 
	Instead, the Scenario Outline is run once for each row in the Examples section beneath it (not counting the first header row).
	The steps can use <> delimited parameters that reference headers in the examples table. 
	Cucumber will replace these parameters with values from the table before it tries to match the step against a step definition.
	You can also use parameters in multiline step arguments.

	eg:
		Scenario Outline: eating
		  Given there are <start> cucumbers
		  When I eat <eat> cucumbers
		  Then I should have <left> cucumbers

		  Examples:
			| start | eat | left |
			|    12 |   5 |    7 |
			|    20 |   5 |   15 |
